# Vehicle Authorization Database Structure Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a comprehensive Microsoft Access database structure to store all information from the provided JSON files. The database follows a normalized relational design with the **Applications** table as the main table using `ApplicationID` as the primary key.

## Database Creation Status
✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
- **15 Tables Created**
- **27 Indexes Created** (including primary keys and performance indexes)
- **Main Table**: Applications (with ApplicationID as primary key)
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Properly established between related tables

## Main Tables Structure

### 1. **Applications** (Main Table)
- **Primary Key**: `ApplicationID` (TEXT 50)
- **Purpose**: Core table storing vehicle authorization application information

  - Vehicle Identifier, Legal Denomination, Member States
  - Contact Person, Financial Contact, Billing Information references
- **Field Count**: 33 fields
- **Relationships**: Connected to Issues, VehicleTypes, and other related tables

### 2. **Issues**
- **Primary Key**: `IssueID` (TEXT 50)
- **Foreign Key**: `ApplicationID` → Applications
- **Purpose**: Track issues and problems related to applications
- **Key Fields**: Title, Description, Owner, Assignees, Status, Due Date, Resolution
- **Field Count**: 19 fields

### 3. **VehicleTypes**
- **Primary Key**: `VehicleTypeID` (TEXT 100)
- **Foreign Key**: `ApplicationID` → Applications
- **Purpose**: Store vehicle type, variant, and version information
- **Key Fields**: Type Name, Authorization Type, Vehicle Category, Creation Date
- **Field Count**: 21 fields

### 4. **Bodies**
- **Primary Key**: `BodyID` (TEXT 100)

- **VehiclesToAuthorise**: Specific vehicles within vehicle types
- **ApplicableRules**: Regulatory rules and directives
- **MemberStateMappings**: Country-specific operational data
- **Networks**: Network information for member states
- **AgencyMappings**: Agency requirements and mappings

## Data Types Used
- **TEXT(n)**: Variable length text fields with specified maximum length
- **MEMO**: Long text fields for descriptions and multi-value data
- **DATETIME**: Date and time fields
- **YESNO**: Boolean fields
- **AUTOINCREMENT**: Auto-incrementing numeric fields

## Indexes for Performance
- **Primary Key Indexes**: On all main tables
- **Foreign Key Indexes**: For relationship performance
- **Query Performance Indexes**: On frequently searched fields like:
  - Applications.ApplicationStatus
  - Applications.ApplicationType
  - Issues.ApplicationID
  - VehicleTypes.ApplicationID

## Key Design Features

### 1. **Normalized Structure**
- Eliminated data redundancy by separating addresses, contact details
- Proper foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- Flexible body types accommodate different organization roles

### 2. **Scalability**
- Designed to handle complex nested JSON data structures
- Support for multiple vehicle types per application
- Multiple issues per application tracking
- Flexible staff assignment system

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Primary key constraints on all tables
- Foreign key relationships where appropriate
- Proper field sizing based on JSON data analysis

## JSON Data Mapping

The database structure captures all major elements from your JSON files:

### Application List JSON → Applications Table
- Application metadata, status, dates, identifiers
- Project information and legal details
- Member state information

### Application Details JSON → Multiple Tables
- Contact persons → ContactPersons, Addresses, ContactDetails
- Billing information → BillingInformation
- Vehicle types/variants → VehicleTypes, VehiclesToAuthorise
- Bodies → Bodies (Applicant, Notified, Designated, Assessment)
- Rules → ApplicableRules
- Member state mappings → MemberStateMappings, Networks

### Issues JSON → Issues Table
- Issue tracking with full details
- Assignment and resolution tracking
- Linked to parent applications

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Data Import**
The database is ready to receive data from your JSON files. You can:
- Use Access import wizards
- Create custom import procedures
- Build data transformation scripts

### 2. **Querying**
Key queries you can now perform:
- Find all applications by status or type
- Track issues for specific applications
- Analyze vehicle types and authorizations
- Report on member state coverage
- Monitor staff assignments

### 3. **Reporting**
The normalized structure supports complex reporting:
- Application status dashboards
- Issue tracking reports
- Vehicle authorization summaries
- Body and contact directories
